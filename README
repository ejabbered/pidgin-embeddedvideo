Pidgin Embedded Video is a GTK plugin for the popular instant messaging client [http://pidgin.im/ Pidgin]. The purpose of this plugin is to provide a faster way to watch videos while chatting with your friends. No more additional browser windows! It transforms a simple conversation into a much more attractive and interesting experience. Sharing links to videos and watching them was never such a pleasant activity in Pidgin. Take a quick look!

== Features ==

  * The plugin automatically inserts the video pointed to into the conversation when an appropriate link is sent or received.
  * Every video has a toggle button which allows you to show or hide the video.
  * The default behaviour for a new video link is customizable from the "[http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-embeddedvideo/wiki/Screenshots#Configuration Configure Plugin]" menu. You can choose whether to show the video instantly or to hide it by default.
