# Pidgin Embedded Video

_(Currently unmaintained due to lack of time.)_

Pidgin Embedded Video is a GTK plugin for the popular instant messaging client [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/). The purpose of this plugin is to provide a faster way to watch videos while chatting with your friends. No more additional browser windows! It transforms a simple conversation into a much more attractive and interesting experience. Sharing links to videos and watching them was never such a pleasant activity in Pidgin. Take a quick look!

## Features

  * The plugin automatically inserts the video into the conversation when an appropriate link is sent or received.
  * Every video has a toggle button which allows you to show or hide the video.
  * The default behaviour for a new video link is customizable from the ["Configure Plugin"](/screenshots/configuration.png) menu. You can choose whether to show the video instantly or to hide it by default.
  * Supported video sites are [CollegeHumor](http://www.collegehumor.com), [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com), [Metacafe](http://www.metacafe.com), [MySpace Video](http://vids.myspace.com), [Trilulilu](http://www.trilulilu.ro) (all the stuff: [audio](http://www.trilulilu.ro/audio), [images](http://www.trilulilu.ro/imagini) and [video](http://www.trilulilu.ro/video)), [Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com) and [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com).
  * It works with the Ubuntu version of Pidgin. It should work on every Linux distribution as far as the [requirements](/InstallationGuide.md#requirements) are met.

## Upcoming Features

We think a Windows version of this plugin would be great for many people too. We are trying to do this for some time but we faced some compilation problems. If you are enthusiastic about this project and you want to help us to move forward, feel free to contact us.

## How to install

First, download the appropriate version from the [downloads](/downloads) folder. Then, follow the steps from the [Installation Guide](/InstallationGuide.md).
